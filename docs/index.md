#### Abstract 
Text-to-music models have revolutionized the creative landscape, offering new possibilities for music creation. Yet their integration into musiciansâ€™ workflows remains underexplored. This paper presents a case study on how TTM models impact music production, based on a user study of their effect on producers' creative workflows. Participants produce tracks using a custom tool combining TTM and source separation models. Semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis reveal key challenges, opportunities, and ethical considerations. The findings offer insights into the transformative potential of TTMs in music production, as well as challenges in their real-world integration.
