# AiMusicProductionUserStudy

This document contains brief notes related to the supplementary material of the submitted paper. The supplementary material contains there are four folders with the following structure (IDNUMBER is the anonymized ID assigned to a participant) and the Python code of the interface used for this experiment. 

Data created during generation
#ID_IDNUMBER → main folder
* final_audio_track_IDNUMBER.mp3 → (final audio track produced by the participant)

* interaction_example_video_IDNUMBER_excerp_1.mp4 → (excerpt from the video)

* …

* interaction_example_video_IDNUMBER_excerp_n.mp4 → (excerpt from the video)

* musicgen_created_loops_IDNUMBER (audio samples created during generation)

   * …mp3

   * …mp3

   * …mp3


Interface code
      * interface_code_ai_music_production.py contains the python code for executing interface.
Can be run by simply typing python interface_code_ai_music_production.py on a terminal and then connecting via browser on the port specified by the model.


The supplementary material will be shared with the community in case of acceptance of the paper on a web accompanying page, with additional results from other participants to the study.
